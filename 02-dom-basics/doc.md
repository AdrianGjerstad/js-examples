# DOM Basics

DOM - Document Object Model, the JavaScript engine's view of a webpage.

In this example I used `document.querySelector`, which uses the same syntax as a
CSS selector to get a `<p>` element from the DOM. It then changes the text in
this element. This all happens after 5 seconds to allow some time to see what
is happening.
